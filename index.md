# Introduction

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, elderly individuals were more vulnerable to the terrible virus's fatal effects. As a result, social distancing was necessary between individuals of all ages, but particularly with the elderly, in order to prevent compromising their well-being. Although this preventive measure was essential during the epidemic, a number of additional problems emerged in the lives of numerous elderly individuals, with feelings of depression and isolation brought on by isolation being among them.


# The Problem

Social isolation is a major problem, as loneliness affects many aspects of mental and physical well-being, such as an increased risk of depression and cardiovascular disease. As mentioned earlier, the elderly were more susceptible to the direct effects of the pandemic, such as health complications, but they were also more susceptible to the secondary effects that came from social distancing and quarantining. This resulted in many individuals suffering from depression and feelings of loneliness. According to [some canada.ca source], the absolute percentage of Canadian adults aged 65 to 84 who reported feeling lonely some of the time increased by around 11.5% from pre-pandemic times to during the pandemic. We will attempt to tackle this important problem using modern smartphone technology. 


# The Solution

Although the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about a number of problems and difficulties, it has also made a large number of seniors more acquainted with technology. Social media and smartphone usage among the senior population increased significantly when social distancing became essential in 2021, rising from 18% in 2013 to 83% for those aged between 50 and 64 and 61% for those over 65 (1). 

For that reason, our mobile application [name] aims to improve the physical and mental well-being of senior citizens by providing them with a range of features that enable them to connect with other people and form new relationships regardless of their circumstances. In addition, the app would have a variety of features, such as inspirational quotes, daily to-do lists, and a mood chart that users could customize to their liking.


# Topic Research

## A Look Into the Social Media Applications

For simplicity, video chatting applications have proven to have a significant impact on the lives of many. In 2012 and 2014, a study was conducted on elderly citizens averaging the age of 64.5 in the United States to understand in greater detail the impacts that the use of different communication platforms had on 1,424 participants. The use of email, instant messaging, or even social media was proven to not have affected in any way any depressive symptoms that the users may have had within two years. On the other hand, video chat application Skype had a significant decrease of approximately 50% of users who were probable of having depressive symptoms. This comes to show that video chatting compared to the other means of communication presented a lower risk for its users from possibly developing depression due to the verbal and visual communication it offers.

Furthermore, another social media application that demonstrated many improvements in the lives of many elderly citizens is Facebook. Numerous people are able to stay connected with friends and loved ones, potentially allowing them to feel less isolated thanks to their feelings of community and belonging. This is particularly helpful to people that live in nursing homes and that would like to keep in touch with their closed ones or that would simply like to meet all kinds of new people using the application.


## Cons to The Current Social Mobile Applications

There are some drawbacks to this app that we would like to improve. Since Facebook Messenger is ultimately linked to Facebook the elderly user will need to create a Facebook profile. Creating a Facebook profile page can cause social anxiety, especially for new users, which will negatively impact user’s mental well being. This social anxiety can even negatively impact their feelings of loneliness. They can better connect with new people but at the same time they will care more about how they are perceived on facebook than emotionally connecting to their facebook friends and family. [5] Facebook is also susceptible to fraud, unethical advertising, and manipulation of user’s opinions. The elderly are an unfortunate target for these practices especially if they are new users of social media technology they will not be able to look out for the signs of fraud.  


## Surveys


## Quotes (if we have)


## Personas

Based on our target audience for this application and on our results, we created two different personas that allow us to visualize their different perspectives.


The first persona, Julia, represents most of the users who would be considered as listeners and who would be volunteering to speak with other users, mainly elderly citizens. These listeners would allow senior citizens to have someone to speak to, no matter their circumstances.

The second person that was created is that of Robert, who is a 74-year-old man looking to make some new connections. Unlike Julia, Robert is a bit more introverted and has been struggling with various mental health issues.

## User Goals

On Julia’s side, her goals consist of wanting to connect with people in need of some help in order to better their physical and mental health. She wants to give many individuals a sense of security when it comes to the topic of mental health. Julia believes that allowing people to be seen and heard could immensely help with their current state despite their circumstances and believes in a potential growth within them.

As for Robert, his goals mostly revolve around wanting to improve his mental state as well as finding a better way to make new connections. He also wishes to be more connected to his family despite the distance between them.


## User Journeys

A user journey is the series of events that users, modeled by our personas in this case, go through. User journeys were essential to better understand the user experience of GreenMind. It allowed us to understand, driven by their motivations, what actions could the user take in the channels offered and what were the user’s paint points. The pain points being the challenges/frustrations the user had when trying to achieve their objectives using our app.

Julia was frustrated with not being able to find more non-listener users of the app through community posts or find users who did not post anything on community posts. We fixed this pain point by making a users page which is organized from new users to old users and where you can search through all of these users

Robert had some trouble messaging people. He would go on people’s profiles and would not find a way to message them. He is used to facebook where a blue message icon labeled with the word “message” can be clicked to messages friends and family. We fixed this by having a larger message label that resembles the facebook messenger symbol.

# Design Process


## Sketch


## Wireframe


## Inspiration Board

In order to create design GreenMind, we have inspired ourselves from a lot of different inspiration boards. Firstly, we followed a similar style to that of other mental health applications. We used a minimalistic design that is a bit bubblier to make it feel more welcoming.

![inspiration](https://github.com/Lorenzo767/Lorenzo767.github.io/blob/main/Inspiration.png?raw=true)

Additionally, we decided to go for a leaf-like design mainly because it represents calmness, joy, and many other positive emotions, which are elements we wish to bring with our design. Since this application targets specifically the elderly community, it was extremely crucial to make sure that it caters to that audience by implementing trendy UI designs such as the Bauhaus design.

## Color Palette

As mentioned previously, we decided to go for an earthy look to represent many good emotions such as serenity and happiness, which reflects on the goal of our application. For that reason, we decided to use green as our primary color following with [other colors we potentially use]. The colors come off as very soft and easy to look at, which attempts to make users feel at peace and secure.

## Typography

For the font of GreenMind, we decided to go with Inter, being that it is a very simple yet elegant font that matches well the application. Additionally, in order to separate regular texts from more important ones, we used bold typography to be easily eligible, which is an important asset for an application such as this. Furthermore, we wanted to prevent using overly elegant or aggressive fonts which could potentially be offensive to certain individuals, making Inter perfect for our application.

## Naming and Logo

In terms of the name of our logo, we decided to go with something simplistic and easy to understand from a first glance. GreenMind can be separated into two terms, “Green” and “Mind”. On one hand, the first time is to represent the aesthetic that we picked to fit the overall theme. On the other hand, “Mind” is to represent a person’s mind, either for listeners or regular users. The word “GreenMind” combined allows to reflect a user’s sense of security and calmness  when opening the application.
